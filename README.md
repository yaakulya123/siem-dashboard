A beautiful, modern **SOC-as-a-Service platform** with separate interfaces for clients and SOC managers. Built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript, this solution provides a white-labeled frontend for Wazuh SIEM without exposing the underlying technology to clients.

## Architecture

This platform has two distinct interfaces:

### 1. Client Interface (`/`)
The client-facing dashboard where organizations can monitor their security posture without seeing that Wazuh powers the backend.

### 2. SOC Manager Interface (`/manager`)
A dedicated interface for SOC team members to manage multiple client instances, view analytics, and oversee operations.

## Features

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SIEM_Data
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the interfaces**
   - Client Interface: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - SOC Manager Interface: [http://localhost:3000/manager](http://localhost:3000/manager)

## Project Structure

The project uses Next.js App Router with route groups for clean separation:

```
src/
  app/
    (client)/     # Client interface routes
      dashboard/
      alerts/
      tickets/
      reports/
      compliance/
      users/
      layout.tsx  # Client-specific layout with sidebar
    
    manager/      # SOC Manager interface routes
      layout.tsx  # Manager-specific layout
      page.tsx    # Client overview dashboard
  
  components/
    layout/
      sidebar.tsx         # Client sidebar
      manager-sidebar.tsx # Manager sidebar
      header.tsx          # Client header
      manager-header.tsx  # Manager header
```

## White-Labeling

This solution is designed as a white-labeled SOC-as-a-Service platform:
- Clients see only their branded interface
- No mention of Wazuh or backend SIEM technology
- Customizable branding per client
- Consistent user experience

## Integration Ready

This frontend is designed to integrate with:
- **Wazuh**: Security monitoring and alerting (hidden from clients)
- **Elasticsearch**: Data storage and search
- **Ticketing Systems**: Jira, ServiceNow
- **Identity Providers**: SAML, OIDC, OAuth
- **Email Services**: Report distribution

## Next Steps

To make this production-ready:
1. **API Integration**: Connect to real Wazuh and other backend services
2. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication system
3. **Database**: Set up persistent storage for client configurations
4. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for live updates
5. **Multi-tenancy**: Enhance client isolation and data segregation
6. **Deployment**: Set up CI/CD pipeline and hosting
